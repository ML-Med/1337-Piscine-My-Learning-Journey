# 1337 Piscine – My Learning Journey  

This repository is a collection of what I learned during the **1337 / 42 Piscine**.  
It reflects my progress in **C programming** and **Shell scripting**, with a focus on building real problem-solving skills.

## 🧑‍💻 C Programming – What I Learned  

- Working with **variables and data types**  
- Writing **functions** to organize code  
- Manipulating **arrays and strings** manually  
- Using **structures** for grouped data  
- Understanding **pointers** and memory addressing  
- Allocating and freeing memory with **`malloc`** and **`free`**  
- Handling **files** with `open`, `read`, `write`, `close`  
- Discovering **system calls** and process basics

## 🐚 Shell Scripting – What I Learned  

- Writing **simple and advanced shell scripts**  
- Using **conditions, loops, and variables** in Bash  
- Working with **permissions, redirections, and pipes**  
- Automating repetitive tasks in the shell  
- Managing environments and processes more efficiently

## ⚡ Key Takeaways  

- I improved my **debugging skills** (finding and fixing errors step by step)  
- I learned to **respect coding standards** with the 42 Norm  
- I trained myself to **think algorithmically** instead of guessing  
- I got comfortable using **Unix/Linux tools** in daily work  
- I learned how to **work under time pressure** and stay consistent

## 🛠️ Tools I Used  

- **gcc** for compiling  
- **make / Makefile** for project builds  
- **nano / vim** for editing  
- **bash / zsh** for scripting  
- **norminette** for style checking

## 🚀 Reflection  

This Piscine wasn’t just about syntax.  
It was about **learning how to learn**, solving problems through logic, and pushing myself every day.
