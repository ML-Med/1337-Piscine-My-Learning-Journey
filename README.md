42 Piscine – C Programming & Shell Scripting

This repository contains my work and learning journey from the 1337 / 42 Piscine, where I practiced intensive C programming and Shell scripting.

The projects here focus on mastering the fundamentals of low-level programming, memory management, and automation through the Unix shell.

📚 What’s Inside
🔹 C Programming

Understanding data types and variables

Implementing functions and modular code

Working with arrays and strings

Using structures to organize data

Mastering pointers and memory addressing

Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free)

File operations (open, read, write, close)

System calls and process management

🔹 Shell Scripting

Writing basic and advanced shell scripts

Automating repetitive tasks

Managing environments and processes

Using redirections, pipes, and permissions

Applying scripting to project workflows

🚀 Goals of the Piscine

Build a solid foundation in C programming

Develop problem-solving and debugging skills

Learn how to think algorithmically

Gain confidence with Unix/Linux tools

Apply Shell scripting for real-world automation

🛠️ Tools & Environment

Ubuntu / Linux (1337 school PCs)

gcc compiler

make / Makefile for project builds

vim / nano for code editing

bash / zsh for shell scripting

📌 Notes

All code follows the 42 Norm (Norminette) coding standards

Only allowed functions were used in projects (e.g., write() instead of printf())

Exercises were completed under Piscine time constraints
